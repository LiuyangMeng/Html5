1
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,755
黑暗
Darkness.

2
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,134
我最先记起的就是黑暗
That's the first thing I remember.

3
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,801
又黑又冷
It was dark, and it was cold.

4
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,303
我很害怕
And I was scared.

5
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,014
但就在那时
But then,

6
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,479
我看见了月亮
then I saw the moon.

7
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,862
那么大 那么亮
It was so big and it was so bright.

8
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,573
月光驱走了黑暗
It seemed to chase the darkness away.

9
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,654
当黑暗消失
And when it did,

10
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,865
我也就不再害怕了
I wasn't scared anymore.

11
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,877
我不知道自己为何出现
Why I was there and what I was meant to do,

12
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,717
应该做些什么
that I've never known.

13
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,183
我甚至怀疑自己永远不会知道
And a part of me wonders if I ever will.

14
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,143
你好啊 你好
Hello. Hello.

15
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,946
晚上好呀 女士 女士?
Good evening, ma'am. Ma'am?

16
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,858
噢 抱歉 能告诉我这是哪里吗?
Oh, uh, excuse me. Can you tell me where I am?

17
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,449
有人听到吗?
Hello?

18
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,790
我叫杰克冻人
My name is Jack Frost.

19
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,289
我是怎么知道名字的呢?
How do I know that?

20
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,958
月亮告诉我的
The moon told me so.

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,344
不过他只告诉过我这些
But that was all he ever told me.

22
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:36,300
那也是很久很久以前了
And that was a long, long time ago.

23
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,420
还在等着饼干呢!
Still waiting for cookies!

24
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,093
好了!
Yes!

25
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,517
啊 终于好了!
Ah, finally!

26
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,437
嗯! 不错
Mmm! Mmm.

27
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,791
我说过多少次要敲门了?
How many times have I told you to knock?

28
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,873
什么?
What?

29
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,083
"地球"出了问题?
The Globe?

30
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,292
走开 尖脑袋们
Shoo with your pointy heads.

31
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,135
你们干嘛总穿着防护罩?
Why are you always under boot?

32
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,980
怎么回事?
What is this?

33
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,564
检查过轴了吗? 自转平衡吗?
Have you checked the axis? Is rotation balanced?

34
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,933
会不会是?
Can it be?

35
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,639
小精灵们!
Dingle!

36
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,854
准备好吧
Make preparations.

37
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,014
我们的伙伴要来了
We are going to have company.

38
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,001
18颗中门牙
Eighteen central incisors.

39
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,218
莫斯科 第九区 22颗门牙 18颗前臼齿
Moscow, sector 9. 22 incisors, 18 premolars.

40
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,041
糟了 大雨警报
Uh-oh. Heavy rain advisory.

41
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,843
得梅因(美国爱荷华州首府) 枫树23区有颗乳牙 就位!
Des Moines, we've got a cusped at 23 Maple. Head out!

42
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,720
等等! 这是她的第一颗牙齿
Wait! It's her first tooth.

43
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,847
你们一生中 还有见过比这颗
Have you ever seen a more adorable lateral incisor

44
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,018
更可爱的侧门牙吗?
in all of your life?

45
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,641
瞧瞧它多洁白
Look how she flossed.

46
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,355
我的守护者伙伴们
My fellow Guardians,

47
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,697
我们的职责是守护全世界的孩子们
it is our job to watch over the children of the world

48
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,527
保护他们的安全
and keep them safe.

49
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,615
给他们带来奇迹 希望和梦想
To bring wonder, hope, and dreams.

50
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,784
今日我召集你们来此 只有一个原因
And so I have called us all here for one reason,

51
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,835
也是唯一的原因
and one reason only.

52
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,913
孩子们有难了
The children are in danger.

53
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,226
我们牵制了几个世纪的敌人
An enemy we have kept at bay for centuries

54
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,058
终于决心反击了
has finally decided to strike back.

55
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,099
只有我们可以阻止他
We alone can stop him.

56
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,523
啊 冻死了!
Oh, it's freezing!

57
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,612
哎呀 我脚都冻得没知觉了! 没知觉了!
Oh, I can't feel my feet! I can't feel my feet!

58
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,538
饼干? 蛋酒? 有人要吗?
Cookies? Eggnog? Anyone?

59
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,082
这次最好说正事 诺斯
This better be good, North.

60
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,992
沙沙 感谢你能来
Sandy, thank you for coming.

61
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,127
我知道 知道
I know, I know.

62
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,588
但是要不是事态严峻
But I obviously wouldn't have called you all here

63
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,086
我也决不会把你们都召集过来
unless it was serious.

64
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,299
嘘!
Shh!

65
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,754
食虫人来了! 来北极了!
The Boogeyman was here! At the Pole!

66
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,088
食虫人?
Pitch?

67
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,011
食虫人来这了?
Pitch Black? Here?

68
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,182
是的
Yes.

69
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,098
当时黑色沙砾笼罩了整个"地球"
There was black sand covering the Globe.

70
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,517
黑色沙砾是什么意思?
What do you mean, black sand?

71
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,314
然后出现了黑影!
And then a shadow!

72
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,431
等等 等等 你不是说看到食虫人了吗
Hold on, hold on. I thought you said you saw Pitch.

73
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,435
其实 也不算看到啦
Well, uh, not exactly.

74
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,604
"不算"? 这家伙能信吗?
"Not exactly"? Can you believe this guy?

75
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,066
是呀 你说对了 沙沙
Yeah. You said it, Sandy.

76
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,828
听好了 他肯定在策划什么阴谋
Look, he's up to something very bad.

77
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,155
我的肚子里
I feel it

78
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,623
有所感应
in my belly.

79
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,376
等会 等会 你是说 离复活节还有三天的时候
Hang on, hang on. You mean to say you summoned me here

80
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,250
你把我们召唤过来就是因为你肚子?
three days before Easter because of your belly?

81
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,570
老兄 要是离圣诞节还有三天的时候我这么对你...
Mate, if I did this to you three days before Christmas...

82
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,627
拜托了 兔子 复活节又不是圣诞
Please, Bunny. Easter is not Christmas.

83
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,132
开始说正事吧
Here we go.

84
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,971
诺斯 我可没时间闲聊!
North, I don't have time for this!

85
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,258
我还要涂完两百万个蛋呢!
I've still got two million eggs to finish up!

86
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,268
不管你再怎么涂 这依旧只是个蛋
No matter how much you paint, is still egg.

87
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,061
听好了 老兄 彩蛋的储存期很短
Look, mate, I'm dealing with perishables.

88
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,477
是吧? 圣诞礼物却能准备一年!
Right? You've got all year to prepare!

89
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,392
兔子为什么总这么紧张?
Why are rabbits always so nervous?

90
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,995
你为什么总这么爱吹牛?
And why are you always such a blowhard?

91
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,363
牙牙! 你没看到我们正要辩论吗?
Tooth! Can't you see we're trying to argue?

92
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,029
抱歉 不是所有人一年只需要工作一个晚上的
Sorry. Not all of us get to work one night a year.

93
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,527
我说得对吧 沙沙?
Am I right, Sandy?

94
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,658
圣地亚哥 2区
San Diego, sector 2.

95
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,831
别疑神疑鬼了 兄弟 食虫人已经和黑暗时代一同消失了
Come on, mate. Pitch went out with the Dark Ages.

96
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,452
我们都确定了
We made sure of it.

97
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,082
我知道就是他 我们情势危急啊
I know it was him. We have serious situation.

98
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,505
我倒是陷入了处理彩蛋的危机中
Well, I've got a serious situation with some eggs.

99
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,928
啊! 是月中人!
Ah! Man in Moon!

100
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,136
沙沙 你怎么不早说呢?
Sandy, why didn't you say something?

101
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,018
很久没见啦 老朋友
It's been a long time, old friend.

102
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,228
这次又有什么消息?
What is big news?

103
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,495
是食虫人
It is Pitch.

104
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,588
月中人 我们该怎么办?
Manny, what must we do?

105
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,018
嘿 伙计们 你们知道这什么意思?
Uh, guys, you know what this means?

106
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,220
他正在挑选一名新的守护者
He's choosing a new Guardian.

107
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,929
什么? 为什么?
What? Why?

108
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,229
肯定有大事 月中人认为我们需要帮手
Must be big deal. Manny thinks we need help.

109
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,435
我们何时起需要帮手了?
Since when do we need help?

110
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,899
我想知道会选谁!
I wonder who it's gonna be!

111
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,980
也许是小矮妖?
Maybe the Leprechaun?

112
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,102
千万别选土拨鼠 千万别选土拨鼠啊
Please not the Groundhog, please not the Groundhog.

113
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,286
杰克冻人
Jack Frost.

114
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,879
我收回刚才的话 土拨鼠其实不错
Uh, I take it back. The Groundhog's fine.

115
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,162
只要能帮忙保护孩子们就行 对吧?
As long as he helps to protect the children. Right?

116
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,335
杰克冻人? 他一点都不关心孩子们!
Jack Frost? He doesn't care about children!

117
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,836
是吧? 他只会不停冰冻水管
All right? All he does is freeze water pipes

118
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,884
然后捣乱我的寻蛋活动!
and mess with my egg hunts!

119
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,680
是吧? 他是个不负责任又自私的...
All right? He's an irresponsible, selfish...

120
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,054
守护者
Guardian.

121
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,848
杰克冻人可以做很多事
Jack Frost is many things,

122
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,766
但绝对做不了守护者
but he is not a Guardian.

123
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,440
呀! 啊!
Ya! Ugh!

124
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,995
噢! 这可真有趣啊
Oh! Now that, that was fun.

125
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,124
嘿 风儿!
Hey, wind!

126
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,007
带我回家吧
Take me home.

127
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,853
下雪咯!
Snow day!

128
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,851
噢! 冻住了!
Oh! It's freezing!

129
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,572
好爽!
Yeah!

130
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,237
哇! 哇!
Whoa! Whoa!

131
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,910
看起来挺有趣 好书吧?
Oh, that looks interesting. Good book?

132
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,669
好哟!  耶!
All right! Yeah!

133
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,247
下雪了!  下雪了! 真棒
Snow day! Snow day! Yeah.

134
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,582
不用谢啦
You're welcome.

135
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,009
嘿 兄弟们 等等! 这个礼拜天的寻蛋活动你们来吗?
Hey, guys, wait up! Are you guys coming to the egg hunt Sunday?

136
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,423
当然来了! 有免费的糖果呢
Yeah! Free candy.

137
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,663
希望雪这么大我们也能找到彩蛋!
I hope we can find the eggs with all this snow!

138
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,138
这上面说在密歇根找到了大脚怪的毛发样本
It says here that they found Bigfoot hair samples

139
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,312
还有DNA呢!
and DNA in Michigan!

140
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,933
很接近人类啊!
That's like super-close!

141
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,265
又来了
Here we go again.

142
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,350
你也看到视频啦 克劳德 他是存在的
You saw the video too, Claude. He's out there.

143
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,148
外星人你也说存在
That's what you said about aliens.

144
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,857
还有复活节兔子!
And the Easter Bunny!

145
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,197
复活节兔子是真实存在的
The Easter Bunny is real.

146
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,403
嗯 他确实是真的
Oh, he's real all right.

147
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,281
真的很讨厌 脾气真心坏 也真心自大
Real annoying, real grumpy and really full of himself.

148
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,921
拜托了! 你们这群人迟早会相信一切的
Come on! You guys will believe anything.

149
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,655
复活节兔子 跳啊 跳啊 跳!
Easter Bunny, hop, hop, hop!

150
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,833
哎哟!  老妈 苏菲又摔跤啦!
Ow! Mom, Sophie fell again!

151
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,285
你没事吧 苏菲?
You okay, Soph?

152
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,494
杰米 戴上帽子
Jamie, hat.

153
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,796
我们可不想让杰克冻人冻掉你的鼻子
We don't want Jack Frost nipping at your nose.

154
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,168
杰克冻人是谁?
Who's Jack Frost?

155
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,966
不是什么人 宝贝 只是个比喻
No one, honey. It's just an expression.

156
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,133
嘿!
Hey!

157
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,005
"谁是杰克冻人?"
"Who's Jack Frost?"

158
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,396
说吧 谁扔的?
Okay, who threw that?

159
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,394
肯定不是大脚怪啦 小屁孩
Well, it wasn't Bigfoot, kiddo.

160
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,317
啊!
Ahhh!

161
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,566
杰米・班尼特 你不合规矩!
Jamie Bennett, no fair!

162
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,359
是你先宣战的!
You struck first!

163
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,366
每人都免费来一发!
Free-for-all!

164
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,498
好吧 谁还需要雪球弹药?
All right, who needs ammo?

165
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,346
瞧啊!
Look at that!

166
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,882
糟了! 我打到了小蛋糕!
Crud! I hit Cupcake!

167
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,884
她打到了小蛋糕  你打到小蛋糕了?
She hit Cupcake. You hit Cupcake?

168
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,177
痛!
Ohhh!

169
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,724
是你扔的吗?  不是
Did you throw that? No.

170
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,271
也不是我!
It wasn't me!

171
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,112
哎呀 有点滑!  哦!
Oh, a little slippery! Ooh!

172
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,677
杰米 小心!  哇!
Jamie, watch out! Whoa!

173
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,577
滑到街上了  快停下! 有车!
That's the street. Stop! There's traffic!

174
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,741
哇! 别担心 杰米 我看着你呢 坚持呀!
Whoa! Don't worry, Jamie. I got you. Hold on!

175
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,450
肯定没事的!
It's gonna be all right!

176
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,495
跟上我吧 孩子! 左转咯!
Keep up with me, kid! Take a left!

177
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,625
嘿 慢点!
Hey, slow down!

178
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,673
停下 别 别 别这样
Hold up. No, no, no, no.

179
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,212
那是杰米・班尼特吗?
Is that Jamie Bennett?

180
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,920
这边请  不 别呀!
There you go. No, no!

181
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,717
哇!
Whoa!

182
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,691
天啊!  耶!
Oh, my gosh! Yeah!

183
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,113
哇 看起来挺严重啊  杰米 你没事吧?
Wow, that looks serious. Jamie, are you all right?

184
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:21,994
哇!
Whoa!

185
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,743
你们都看见了没? 太惊人了!
Did you guys see that? It was amazing!

186
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,908
我奋力一跃 然后滑着...
I did a jump and I slid under a...

187
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,542
哎呀
Whoops.

188
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,785
哦!
Oh!

189
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,044
太酷了! 一颗牙!
Cool! A tooth!

190
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,046
老兄 一颗牙就代表有钱咯!  牙仙的奖金!
Dude, that means cash! Tooth fairy cash!

191
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,127
不! 喂!  你看起来脏兮兮的!
Oh, no! Oh! You lucky bum!

192
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,054
我要把这个放到我枕头下面!
I got to put this under my pillow!

193
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,052
等一下 喂 等等 等等
Oh, wait a minute. Come on. Hold on, hold on.

194
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,553
我们刚刚那么开心算什么?
What about all the fun we just had?

195
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,351
又不是牙仙的功劳 是我!
That wasn't the Tooth Fairy, that was me!

196
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,923
我的耳朵都冻僵了!
My ears are freezing!

197
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,369
我要怎么做才能让你们小小注意到我?
What's a guy got to do to get a little attention around here?

198
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,063
有一长条雪痕
There was a patch of ice.

199
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,689
我不知道它是怎么出现的
I don't understand how it got here.

200
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,113
我是说 好歹复活节就快到了!
I mean, Easter is around the corner!

201
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,407
太棒了!
...it was awesome!

202
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,734
然后我从小坡上飞了出去
So then I was flying down this hill

203
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,410
飞快飞快地穿梭在车流之中
and it was like whoosh, whoosh, through these cars

204
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,613
然后雪橇撞到这个
and then the sled hit this thing

205
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,159
就像飞到空中一样!
and it was like way up in the air!

206
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,957
然后 砰得一声 沙发砸到了我...
And then, barn, the sofa hit me...

207
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,158
哇!
Wow!

208
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,585
瞧瞧 我的牙掉下来了!
...and see, my tooth came out!

209
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,626
好了 你把牙放到枕头下面了吗?
All right, you. Tooth under your pillow?

210
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,172
是的 准备好了
Yeah, I'm ready.

211
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,171
别熬夜想试图看到牙仙 杰米
Now don't stay up trying to see her, Jamie,

212
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,547
否则她是不会来的啦
or she won't come.

213
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,175
但是这次可以呀! 你想帮我吗 苏菲?
But I can do it this time! You want to help me, Soph?

214
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,471
我们可以藏起来偷看牙仙!
We can hide and see the Tooth Fairy!

215
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,924
好呀 藏起来 藏起来
Hide, hide, hide, hide.

216
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,512
不行 立刻上床睡觉 小伙子
Uh-uh. Straight to bed now, mister.

217
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,593
妈咪
Mom.

218
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,858
如果我做错了什么事
If there's something I'm doing wrong,

219
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,534
你可以告诉我我做错了啥吗?
can you just tell me what it is?

220
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,874
因为我已经尝试了所有办法
Because I've tried everything

221
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,495
却依旧没人能看到我
and no one ever sees me.

222
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,466
你把我丢在这里
You put me here.

223
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,795
至少你也要告诉我...
The least you can do is tell me...

224
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,680
为何把我丢在这
Tell me why.

225
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,825
很准时啊 沙人
Right on time, Sandman.

226
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,690
嗯
Mmm.


227
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:11,202
我觉得我听到了独角兽哒哒的马蹄声
Oh, I thought I heard the clippity-clop of a unicorn.

228
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,200
多么可爱的梦境啊!
What an adorable dream!

229
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,204
瞧瞧她
And look at her.

230
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,546
珍宝般的孩子
Precious child.

231
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,250
真甜美
So sweet.

232
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,461
充满了希望和奇迹
So full of hope and wonder.

233
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,839
然而 却仍缺少了一样东西
Why, there's only one thing missing.

234
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,640
就是一点恐惧
A touch of fear.

235
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,849
唔...
Mmm...

236
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,396
恐惧永不会衰老
That never gets old.

237
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:40,234
感受你的恐惧吧 来吧 来吧 就是这样
Feel your fear. Come on. Come on, that's right.

238
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:45,903
多么美丽的梦魇啊!
Yes, what a pretty little Nightmare!

239
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,238
现在
Now,

240
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:52,705
我要你去告诉其他人 等候期结束了
I want you to go tell the others the wait is over.

241
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,415
别这样看着我啊 老朋友
Don't look at me like that, old friend.

242
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,251
你肯定知道这一天终会到来
You must have known this day would come.

243
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,757
我的梦魇们已经准备就绪
My Nightmares are finally ready.

244
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,506
你的守护者们准备好了吗?
Are your Guardians?

245
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,014
哇!
Whoa!

246
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,084
你好啊 伙伴
Hello, mate.

247
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,967
很久没见了吧 我觉得68年的暴风雪之后就没见过
Been a long time. Blizzard of '68 I believe.

248
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,428
那天是复活节 对吧?
Easter Sunday, wasn't it?

249
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,259
兔子! 你不会还在为那事生气呢吧 对吧?
Bunny! You're not still mad about that, are you?

250
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,641
还气呢
Yes.

251
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,808
但这次是为了别的事来的
But this is about something else.

252
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,597
伙计们
Fellas?

253
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,141
嘿!
Hey!

254
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,391
放我下来! 干嘛呀...
Put me down! What the...

255
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,443
我?
Me?

256
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,408
当然不跟你们一起啦 北极见吧
Not on your nelly. See you back at the Pole.

257
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,299
哇!
Whoa!

258
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,592
他来了
He's here.

259
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,261
安静
Quiet.

260
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,177
嘿! 他来了!
Hey! There he is!

261
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,592
杰克冻人!
Jack Frost!

262
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,761
哇
Wow.

263
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,890
你开玩笑的吧
You got to be kidding me.

264
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,437
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.

265
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,642
放我下来  我希望这些雪人没有怠慢你
Put me down. I hope the yetis treated you well.

266
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,813
是呀
Oh, yeah,

267
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,862
我喜欢被塞到麻袋里 然后扔进魔法大门
I love being shoved in a sack and tossed through a magic portal.

268
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,318
那就好 是我让他们这么做的!
Oh, good. That was my idea!

269
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,866
显然你已经认识兔子了
You know Bunny, obviously.

270
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,985
很明显吧  还有牙仙
Obviously. And the Tooth Fairy.

271
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,669
你好 杰克 我听说过你不少事
Hello, Jack. I've heard a lot about you.

272
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,113
还有你的牙齿!
And your teeth!

273
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,326
我的什么?
My What?

274
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,703
张开嘴! 你的牙真有别人说的那么白吗?
Open up! Are they really as white as they say?

275
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:00,829
真的!
Yes!

276
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,752
真的像刚落下的雪花一样闪耀!
Oh, they really do sparkle like freshly fallen snow!

277
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,459
姑娘们 矜持点!
Girls, pull yourselves together!

278
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,820
不要给我们这身制服丢人
Let's not disgrace the uniform.

279
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,334
还有沙人
And Sandman.

280
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,634
沙沙?
Sandy?

281
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,465
沙沙? 醒醒!
Sandy? Wake up!

282
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,678
嘿 有没有人愿意告诉我 为什么带我来这里?
Hey, ho, anyone want to tell me why I'm here?

283
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,516
嘿 不懂你在说什么
Uh, that's not really helping,

284
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,972
不过还是谢了 小个子
but thanks, little man.

285
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,437
我肯定做了什么坏事 把你们四个都聚在一起了
I must've done something really bad to get you four together.

286
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,022
我是上了什么淘气名单吗?
Am I on the naughty list?

287
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,275
哈! 淘气名单呀?
Ha! On naughty list?

288
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,776
你一直是记录保持者
You hold the record.

289
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,691
不过不要紧 我们是高瞻远瞩的人
But, no matter. We overlook.

290
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,027
现在我们既往不咎了
Now we are wiping clean the slate.

291
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,407
怎么会这样呢?
How come?

292
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,533
啊 问得好
Ah, good question.

293
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,707
怎么回事? 我来告诉你怎么回事!
How come? I tell you how come!

294
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,251
因为你现在是守护者了!
Because now you are Guardian!

295
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,421
你在干嘛? 放开我!
What are you doing? Get off of me!

296
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,824
典礼开始!
This is the best part!

297
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,274
啥?
Huh?

298
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,378
你们怎么会认为我愿意当守护者呢?
What makes you think I want to be a Guardian?

299
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,387
你当然愿意了
Of course you do.

300
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,634
奏起音乐!
Music!

301
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,345
不许奏!
No music!

302
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,890
你们这也太谄媚了 不过我知道
This is all very flattering, but, uh,

303
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,771
你们根本不想要我
you don't want me.

304
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,599
你们都是勤劳的人 做事有底线
You're all hard work and deadlines,

305
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,776
我只会玩雪 到处享乐
and I'm snowballs and fun times.

306
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,319
我不是什么守护者
I'm not a Guardian.

307
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,109
是呀 这正是我说的
Yeah. That's exactly what I said.

308
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,158
杰克 我觉得你不明白我们的职责是什么
Jack, I don't think you understand what it is we do.

309
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,990
这里的每一个亮点都代表一个孩子
Each of those lights is a child.

310
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,663
一个有信念的孩子
A child who believes.

311
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,374
不管他们好还是坏 淘气还是听话
And good or bad, naughty or nice,

312
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,160
我们都会保护他们
we protect them.

313
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,452
啊! 啊!
Ah! Ah!

314
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,209
牙牙! 手拿开
Tooth! Fingers out of mouth.

315
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,541
哦 抱歉 它们太美了
Oh, sorry. They're beautiful.

316
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,134
好了 不说废话了
Okay. No more wishy-washy.

317
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,257
食虫人正在伺机而动!
Pitch is out there doing who knows what!

318
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,179
你是说食虫人?
You mean the Boogeyman?

319
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,099
对! 食虫人威胁着我们
Yes! When Pitch threatens us,

320
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,767
也威胁着孩子们
he threatens them as well.

321
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,595
所以你们该挑选个更加合适的人选
All the more reason to pick someone more qualified.

322
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,646
挑选? 你觉得是被我们挑选出来的?
Pick? You think we pick?

323
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,021
不 你是注定的! 跟我们一样
No, you were chosen! Like we were all chosen.

324
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,397
被月中人选定的
By Man in Moon.

325
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,693
什么?
What?

326
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,737
昨晚 杰克 他选中了你
Last night, Jack, he chose you.

327
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:36,905
可能吧
Maybe.

328
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,534
月中人... 他跟你们说的?
Man in the Moon... He talks to you?

329
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,957
是这样 你不能拒绝 这是命运
You see, you cannot say no. It is destiny.

330
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,745
那他为什么不亲自告诉我?
But why wouldn't he tell me that himself?

331
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,957
经过了300年 这就是他的答复?
After 300 years this is his answer?

332
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,293
让我跟你们一样长生不死
To spend eternity like you guys.

333
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:02,098
永远做一个隐形人 想方设法逗孩子们开心?
Cooped up in some hideout thinking of new ways to bribe kids?

334
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,886
不 不行 我不屑! 无意冒犯
No, no. That's not for me! No offense.

335
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,396
这还叫无意冒犯?
How is that not offensive?

336
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,605
知道我怎么想的吗?
You know what I think?

337
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,149
我觉得我们是徒劳的
I think we just dodged a bullet.

338
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,271
这个小丑
I mean, what's this clown

339
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,274
怎么知道如何给孩子们带去欢乐
know about bringing joy to children anyway.

340
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,731
呃 你听说过雪天吗?
Uh, you ever hear of a snow day?

341
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,068
没有煮老了的鸡蛋 不过孩子们喜欢我做的事情
I know it's no hard-boiled egg, but kids like what I do.

342
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,282
不过没人相信你的存在 对吧?
But none of them believe in you, do they?

343
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,034
你是隐形的 伙计
You see, you're invisible, mate.

344
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,415
跟不存在一样
It's like you don't even exist.

345
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,787
兔子! 够了
Bunny! Enough.

346
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,120
没事 这只袋鼠说得对
No, the kangaroo's right.

347
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,163
这只什么? 你叫我什么?
The what? What did you call me?

348
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,248
我可不是袋鼠 伙计
I'm not a kangaroo, mate.

349
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,796
哦 这么长时间我一直以为你是呢
Oh, and this whole time I thought you were.

350
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:42,047
你要不是袋鼠 是什么?
If you're not a kangaroo, what are you?

351
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,508
我是兔子 复活节兔子
I'm a bunny. The Easter Bunny.

352
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,435
人们相信我的存在
People believe in me.

353
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,194
杰克 跟我来
Jack. Walk with me.

354
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,402
不是有意的 诺斯
It's nothing personal, North.

355
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,609
不过你们做的事情 与我无关
But what you all do, it's just not my thing.

356
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,568
月中人说跟你有关!
Man in Moon says it is your thing!

357
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,744
会有结果的
We will see.

358
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,072
慢点 好吗? 我想溜进来很多年了
Slow down, would you? I've been trying to bust in here for years.

359
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,115
我要好好看看  你说 溜进来?
I want a good look. What do you mean, bust in?

360
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,159
哦 别担心 从来没过过雪人这一关
Oh, don't worry. I never got past the yetis.

361
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,585
哦 嘿 菲尔
Oh, hey, Phil.

362
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,254
跟上 杰克 跟上!
Keep up, Jack, keep up!

363
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,804
喔! 我一直以为玩具是小精灵做的
Whoa! I always thought the elves made the toys.

364
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,306
那是我们制造的假象
We just let them believe that.

365
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,817
很好! 好好干
Very nice! Keep up good work.

366
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,395
我不喜欢! 换成红色!
I don't like it! Paint it red!

367
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,486
大家 加油!
Step it up, everybody!

368
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:02,884
要水果蛋糕吗?
Fruitcake?

369
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,841
呃 不了 谢谢
Uh, no, thanks.

370
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,549
现在我们说正事
Now we get down to tacks of brass.

371
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,430
正事...
Tacks of...

372
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,731
你是谁 杰克冻人?
Who are you, Jack Frost?

373
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,893
你的内心是什么?  我的内心?
What is your center? My center?

374
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,938
如果月中人挑选你作为守护者
If Man in Moon chose you to be a Guardian,

375
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:25,150
你一定拥有与众不同的内心
you must have something very special inside.

376
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,901
嗯
Hmm.

377
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,452
你看
Here.

378
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,541
这就是你看我的形象 不对吗?
This is how you see me, no?

379
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,210
高大 威严
Very big, intimidating.

380
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,462
但如果再深入了解... 打开看看
But if you get to know me a little... Well, go on.

381
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,262
你是个开心果?
You are downright jolly?

382
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,341
不仅仅是开心果!
But not just jolly!

383
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,889
我还神秘
I am also mysterious,

384
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,931
而且无畏
and fearless,

385
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,892
富有同情心!
and caring!

386
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,478
而我的内心呢?
And at my center?

387
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,237
是个木头小娃娃
There's a tiny wooden baby.

388
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,069
仔细看 能看到什么?
Look closer. What do you see?

389
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,454
眼睛很大
You have big eyes.

390
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,624
对! 大眼睛 非常大
Yes! Big eyes. Very big.

391
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,293
因为充满着美好
Because they are full of wonder.

392
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,708
这就是我的内心
That is my center.

393
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,549
是我与生俱来的禀性
It is what I was born with.

394
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:28,130
我的眼睛能看到万事万物中的美好!
Eyes that have always seen the wonder in everything!

395
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:32,718
能看到密林中的光辉和空气中的奇迹
Eyes that see lights in the trees and magic in the air.

396
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:38,306
我把美好带给世界!
This wonder is what I put into the world!

397
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,350
把美好驻留在孩子们心中
And what I protect in children.

398
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,936
这就是我成为了守护者的原因
It is what makes me a Guardian.

399
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,940
这就是我的内心
It is my center.

400
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,450
你的呢?
What is yours?

401
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,405
不知道
I don't know.

402
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,003
有麻烦了 伙计 在牙仙宫殿
We have a problem, mate. Trouble at the Tooth Palace.

403
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,377
诺斯! 诺斯!
North! North!

404
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,712
我说了不跟你们一起了!
I told you I'm not going with you guys!

405
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,015
我才不要坐什么旧得快散架的...
There is no way I'm climbing into some rickety old...

406
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,432
雪橇?
...sleigh?

407
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,569
喔 喔 嘿!
Whoa, whoa, hey!

408
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,294
好吧 只坐一次 就一次好了
Okay. One ride, but that's it.

409
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,542
所有人都喜欢我的雪橇!
Everyone loves the sleigh!

410
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,544
兔子 你还等什么?
Bunny, what are you waiting for?

411
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:50,302
我觉得我的兔子洞会更快一些 伙计 而且更安全
I think my tunnels might be faster, mate, and safer.

412
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:51,970
呃! 进来!  喔!
Ugh! Get in! Whoa!

413
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,509
系好安全带!  喔 喔 喔
Buckle up! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

414
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,216
他妈的安全带在哪呢?
Where are the bloody seatbelts?

415
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,968
哈! 要安全带做什么 准备好了吗?
Ha! That was just expression. Are we ready?

416
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,062
好的 出发! 走!
Good. Let's go! Clear!

417
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,223
驾!
Yah!

418
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,569
别挡路!
Out of the way!

419
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,402
驾!
Yah!

420
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,952
哦 不!
Oh, no!

421
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,545
慢点! 慢点!
Slow down! Slow down!

422
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,088
希望你们喜欢过山车
I hope you like the loopty-loops.

423
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,216
希望你喜欢我吐的胡萝卜
I hope you like carrots.

424
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,468
走啦!
Here we go!

425
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,096
呜呼!
Whoo-hoo!

426
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,145
升空!
Blastoff!

427
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,281
喔!
Whoa!

428
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,947
哦...
Ohhh...

429
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:57,994
嘿 兔子
Hey, Bunny.

430
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,164
看这边
Check out this view.

431
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,075
诺斯! 他...
North! He's...

432
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,287
哦 你还是在意的
Aw, you do care.

433
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,086
哦 滚蛋 你个混蛋爱现鬼!
Oh, rack off, you bloody show pony!

434
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,959
大家 抓紧了! 走捷径了
Hold on, everyone! I know a shortcut.

435
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,921
哦 啊呀 我就知道应该走兔子洞的
Oh, strewth, I knew I should've taken the tunnels.

436
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,132
去牙仙宫殿
I say Tooth Palace.

437
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,093
驾!
Yah!

438
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:26,978
什么?
What?

439
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,356
哦! 喔!
Oh! Whoa!

440
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,479
这是什么?
What are they?

441
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,864
喔!
Whoa!

442
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,431
他们在抓牙仙!
They're taking the tooth fairies!

443
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,458
嘿 小牙仙 你没事吧?
Hey, little Baby Tooth, you okay?

444
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,396
给 你来开  啊?
Here, take over. Huh?

445
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:07,894
驾!
Yah!

446
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,229
驾!
Yah!

447
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,645
他们在偷牙齿!
They're stealing the teeth!

448
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,691
杰克 小心!
Jack, look out!

449
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,166
牙牙! 你没事吧?
Tooth! Are you all right?

450
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,541
他们... 他们抓走了我的精灵
They... They took my fairies.

451
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,546
还偷走了牙齿! 所有的牙齿!
And the teeth! All of them!

452
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,211
全都没了
Everything is gone.

453
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,383
都没了
Everything.

454
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:42,850
哦 谢天谢地 还有一个没事
Oh, thank goodness. One of you is all right.

455
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,679
我要说 这确实 非常刺激
I have to say, this is very, very exciting.

456
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,099
四巨头 都到场了
The Big Four, all in one place.

457
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,601
我都被你们的星光晃晕了
I'm a little starstruck.

458
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,570
你喜欢我在"地球"上的表演吗 诺斯?
Did you like my show on the Globe, North?

459
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,073
把你们都招来了 是吧?
Got you all together, didn't I?

460
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,781
食虫人! 给你30秒把我的精灵们送回来!
Pitch! You have got 30 seconds to return my fairies!

461
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:05,907
不然怎么样? 你往我枕头下放个硬币?
Or what? You'll stick a quarter under my pillow?

462
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,746
你为什么要这样?
Why are you doing this?

463
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,120
可能是我想要你们拥有的
Maybe I want what you have.

464
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,546
想被人们相信
To be believed in.

465
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,760
我厌倦了躲在床下!
Maybe I'm tired of hiding under beds!

466
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,628
也许你就该在那里!
Maybe that's where you belong!

467
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,055
去找彩蛋吧 兔子
Go suck an egg, rabbit.

468
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,890
等等 那是杰克冻人吗?
Hang on. Is that Jack Frost?

469
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,973
你什么时候跟他们那么好了?
Since when are you all so chummy?

470
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,145
还没有
We're not.

471
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,943
哦 好的 中立方
Oh, good. A neutral party.

472
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,445
那我就无视你了
Then I'm going to ignore you.

473
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,065
不过估计你也早就被无视习惯了
But you must be used to that by now.

474
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,242
食虫人 你个躲躲藏藏的败类 过来!
Pitch, you shadow-sneaking ratbag, come here!

475
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,748
喔! 嘿! 放松 姑娘 放松
Whoa! Hey! Easy, girl, easy.

476
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,466
眼熟吗 沙人?
Look familiar, Sandman?

477
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,298
为了把梦境变成梦魇
Took me a while to perfect this little trick.

478
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,092
我花了不少时间去完善这项法力
Turning dreams into Nightmares.

479
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,757
别紧张
Don't be nervous.

480
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,020
这只会惹怒它们 它们能闻到恐惧
It only riles them up more. They smell fear, you know.

481
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,272
什么恐惧? 恐惧你?
What fear? Of you?

482
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,191
黑暗时代以后再也没人害怕你了!
No one's been afraid of you since the Dark Ages!

483
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,819
哦 黑暗时代
Oh, the Dark Ages.

484
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,940
所有人都心惊胆战 真悲惨
Everyone frightened. Miserable.

485
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:26,119
真是我的快乐时光 哦 我曾经的力量
Such happy times for me. Oh, the power I wielded.

486
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,867
可是月中人
But then the Man in the Moon

487
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:32,494
选择用你们的美好和光明来替代我的恐惧
chose you to replace my fear with your wonder and light.

488
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,373
温暖人们的心 带给人们希望
Lifting their hearts and giving them hope.

489
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,384
同时 所有人都把我当做噩梦挥之而去!
Meanwhile, everyone wrote me off as just a bad dream!

490
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,878
"哦 没什么可害怕的"
"Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of."

491
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,552
"根本就没有食虫人!"
"There's no such thing as the Boogeyman!"

492
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,685
哦 这一切都要改变了
Well, that's all about to change.

493
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,189
哦 看啊
Oh, look.

494
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,391
已经开始了
It's happening already.

495
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,563
什么?
What is?

496
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,319
孩子们开始醒来并且意识到
Children are waking up and realizing

497
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,530
牙仙并不存在了
the Tooth Fairy never came.

498
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,072
虽然是件小事 不过对于孩子来说...
I mean, such a little thing. But to a child...

499
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,703
怎么了?
What's going on?

500
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,915
他们... 他们不再相信我了
They... They don't believe in me anymore.

501
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,918
他们没有告诉你吗 杰克?
Didn't they tell you, Jack?

502
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,500
当守护者是很了不起
It's great being a Guardian.

503
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,051
不过有一个死穴
But there's a catch.

504
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,258
如果有足够的孩子不再相信
If enough kids stop believing,

505
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,658
你这些朋友守卫的一切
everything your friends protect,

506
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,426
希望 理想和美梦 都会消退
wonder, hopes and dreams, it all goes away.

507
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,512
然后一点一点的 守护者自己也会消失
And little by little, so do they.

508
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,437
没有圣诞节和复活节
No Christmas or Easter,

509
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,356
也没有夜晚到来的精灵
or little fairies that come in the night.

510
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,946
什么都没有 只剩下恐惧和黑暗
There will be nothing but fear and darkness.

511
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,738
还有我
And me.

512
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,450
该轮到你们不被相信了
It's your turn not to be believed in.

513
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,805
他走了
He's gone.

514
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,394
好吧 我承认
Okay, all right, I admit it.

515
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,316
你说的是真的
You were right about Pitch.

516
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,235
牙仙精灵们的事情我很遗憾
I'm sorry about the fairies.

517
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,482
你真该看看他们 他们那么奋力地抗争
You should have seen them. They put up such a fight.

518
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,319
为什么食虫人要偷走牙齿?
Why would Pitch take the teeth?

519
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,829
他要的不是牙齿
It's not the teeth he wanted.

520
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,323
要的是存在牙齿里的记忆
It's the memories inside them.

521
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,449
什么意思?
What do you mean?

522
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,327
这是我们收藏牙齿的原因 杰克
That's why we collect the teeth, Jack.

523
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:43,173
它们记录着儿时最宝贵的回忆
They hold the most important memories of childhood.

524
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,677
我和我的精灵们看护着它们
My fairies and I watch over them.

525
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,005
当有人需要记起什么最重要的时候
And when someone needs to remember what's important,

526
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,432
我们能帮助他们
we help them.

527
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,136
所有人的都有
We had everyone's here.

528
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,976
还有 你的
Yours, too.

529
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,190
我的记忆?
My memories?

530
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,859
当你还小的时候
From when you were young.

531
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,195
在你成为杰克冻人之前
Before you became Jack Frost.

532
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,949
可是成为杰克冻人之前我谁都不是
But I wasn't anyone before I was Jack Frost.

533
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,034
你当然是
Of course you were.

534
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,282
我们被挑选前 都是普通人
We were all someone before we were chosen.

535
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,197
什么?
What?

536
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,803
你真该看看那时候的兔子
You should have seen Bunny.

537
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,511
嘿 我告诉过你再也不要提了!
Hey, I told you never to mention that!

538
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,834
池塘的那晚 我只是... 我猜...
The night at the pond, I just... I assumed...

539
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,048
你是说...
Are you saying...

540
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,042
你是说在那之前我有自己的生活
Are you saying I had a life before that,

541
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,629
有家和家人吗?
with a home and a family?

542
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,799
你真的想不起来了?
You really don't remember?

543
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,386
这么多年 这答案就在这里
All these years, the answers were right here.

544
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,688
如果我们找回我的记忆 我就能知道我为什么会出现了
If I find my memories, then I'll know why I'm here.

545
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,351
你一定要告诉我!
You have to show me!

546
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,854
不行 杰克 食虫人夺走了牙齿
I can't, Jack. Pitch has them.

547
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,569
那我们必须抢回来了!
Then we have to get them back!

548
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,360
哦 不
Oh, no.

549
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,659
孩子们!
The children!

550
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,074
我们太晚了!
We're too late!

551
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,238
不! 不会的!
No! No!

552
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,207
没有太晚这回事!
No such thing as too late!

553
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,914
嗯...
Hmm...

554
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,917
等等 等等!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

555
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,381
啊?
Huh?

556
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,045
我们来收集牙齿
We will collect the teeth.

557
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,258
什么?
What?

558
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,928
我们收回来牙齿 孩子们就相信你了!
We get teeth, children keep believing in you!

559
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,100
我们说的可是七个大洲数以百万计的孩子!
We're talking seven continents and millions of kids!

560
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,514
得了吧
Give me break.

561
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,062
你知道我一晚能送多少玩具吗?
You know how many toys I deliver in one night?

562
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,440
我一天能藏多少彩蛋?
And eggs I hide in one day?

563
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,026
还有 杰克 如果你来帮忙
And, Jack, if you help us,

564
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,900
我们帮你找回记忆
we will get you your memories.

565
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,949
呃!
Ugh!

566
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,788
我加入
I'm in.

567
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,413
快! 快!
Quickly! Quickly!

568
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,371
快点 兔子! 我领先五颗牙了!
Hop to it, rabbit! I'm five teeth ahead!

569
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,797
听着 我要告诉你别碍我的事
Yeah, right. Look, I'd tell you to stay out of my way,

570
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,131
不过 那么 你又能怎么样呢?
but, really, what's the point?

571
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,379
因为不管怎样你都不能一直领先了
'Cause you won't be able to keep up anyway.

572
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,085
你想挑战我吗 棉尾巴?
Is that a challenge, cottontail?

573
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,892
哦 别想跟兔子比赛 伙计
Oh, you don't want to race a rabbit, mate.

574
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,716
比赛? 有比赛?
A race? Is it a race?

575
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,552
场面会很壮观的!
This is going to be epic!

576
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,808
这里有四颗乳牙! 两个街区以东有颗门牙
Four bicuspids over there! An incisor two blocks east.

577
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,148
那是颗臼齿吗? 到处都是! 哦! 噢!
Is that a molar? They're everywhere! Oh! Ow!

578
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:06,808
你没事吧?
You Okay?

579
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,901
抱歉 我没事
I'm fine. Sorry.

580
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,230
我已经很久没有到过现场了
It's been a really long time since I've been out in the field.

581
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,655
很久是多久?
How long is a long time?

582
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,820
440年 左右吧
440 years, give or take.

583
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,611
嗯
Hmm.

584
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,782
哈!
Ha!

585
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,287
啊哈!
Ahhh!

586
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,625
双胞胎!
Twins!

587
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,253
哦 头奖大礼包!
Oh, jackpot!

588
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,334
看起来你挺猛的 哈 伙计?
Looks like you're a bit of a brumby, eh, mate?

589
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,301
小菜一碟  喔!
Is piece of pie. Ow!

590
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:42,348
那是我的牙齿! 沙沙! 沙沙!
That's my tooth! Sandy! Sandy!

591
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,309

592
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,944
喔 喔 喔! 别动手 老大
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there, champ.

593
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,655
他是自己人! 欧洲的牙仙 对吧?
He's one of us! Part of the European division. Ca va?

594
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,863
哈?
Huh?

595
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,708
哈!
Ha!

596
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,414

不!
No!

599
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,174
哈 哈哈
Ho, ho, ho.

600
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,848
哦! 你们收集牙齿留下礼物的速度
Wow! You guys collect teeth and leave gifts

601
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,770
像我的精灵一样快
as fast as my fairies.

602
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,156
你们记得留下礼物了 对吧?
You guys have been leaving gifts, right?

603
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,750
哈!
Ha!

604
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,935
这光明
The lights.

605
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,101
为什么还不熄灭?
Why aren't they going out?

606
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,900
他们在收集牙齿?
They're collecting the teeth?

607
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,900
安静不然我往你们笼子里塞个枕头!
Pipe down or I'll stuff a pillow with you!

608
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,831
好吧 最后再顽抗一下吧
Fine. Have your last hurrah.

609
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,412
明天
For tomorrow,

610
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,119
你们可悲的抵抗就将形同乌有
all your pathetic scrambling will be for nothing.

611
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,502
左门牙
Left central incisor,

612
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,796
在一次疯狂的雪橇意外中被撞掉
knocked out in a freak sledding accident.

613
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,757
我想知道怎么会发生这种事 杰克
I wonder how that could've happened, Jack.

614
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,590
孩子啊 是吧?
Kids, huh?

615
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,930
这一直是我最喜欢的部分
This was always the part I liked most.

616
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,519
看着孩子
Seeing the kids.

617
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,440
为什么我就是不能自已?
Why did I ever stop doing this?

618
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,821
嗯
Hmm.

619
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,819
在这么近看有些不同 对吧?
It's a little different up close, huh?

620
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,119
谢谢你能来 杰克
Thanks for being here, Jack.

621
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,621
真希望我能知道你的记忆
I wish I'd known about your memory.

622
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,293
我就能帮你了
I could have helped you.

623
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:13,954
对 是...
Yeah, well...

624
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,039
这样 先帮你
Look, let's just get you taken care of.

625
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,632
然后再去搞定食虫人
Then it's Pitch's turn.

626
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:18,947
你在这!
Here you are!

627
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,129
嘘!
Shh!

628
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,057
怎样 笨蛋?
What gives, slowpokes?

629
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,892
你感觉如何 牙牙?
How you feeling, Toothy?

630
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,103
被相信了
Believed in.

631
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,977
我就想听这个
That's what I want to hear.

632
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,650
哦 我知道了 你们结成一伙
Oh, I see how it is. All working together

633
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,693
让兔子得最后一名
to make sure the rabbit gets last place.

634
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,197
你觉得我想赢兔子还需要帮助吗?
You think I need help to beat a bunny?

635
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,032
看看吧 棉尾巴
Check it out, Peter Cottontail.

636
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,488
你那也叫一袋子?
You call that a bag of choppers?

637
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,911
这才是一袋子
Now that's a bag of choppers.

638
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,951
先生们 先生们 这都是为了帮牙牙
Gentlemen, gentlemen. This is about Tooth.

639
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,703
这可不是什么比赛
It's not a competition.

640
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:55,871
但如果是比赛的话 那也是我赢啦! 咦哈!
But if it was, I win! Yee-haw!

641
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,497
哦 不
Oh, no.

642
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,545
圣诞老人?
Santa Claus?

643
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,907
复活节兔子?
The Easter Bunny?

644
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,171
沙人?
Sandman?

645
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,049
还有牙仙! 我就知道你会来的!
The Tooth Fairy! I knew you'd come!

646
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,517
惊喜! 我们来了
Surprise! We came.

647
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,227
他能看到我们?
He can see us?

648
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,556
大多数
Most of us.

649
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,238
嘘! 伙计们 他还醒着
Shh! You guys, he's still awake.

650
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,774
沙沙 打晕他
Sandy, knock him out.

651
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,365
啊?
Huh?

652
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,721
用你的睡梦沙 你个二货!
With the Dreamsand, you gumbies!

653
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,780
不 别咬! 那是复活节的兔子!
No, stop! That's the Easter Bunny!

654
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,373
你要干什么 阿比? 坐下!
What are you doing, Abbey? Down!

655
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,205
好了 全都别慌
All right, nobody panic.

656
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,753
但那是一只猎犬
But that's a greyhound.

657
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,792
你知道猎犬是怎么对付兔子的吗?
Do you know what greyhounds do to rabbits?

658
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,799
我敢肯定它从来没见过我这样的兔子
I think it's a pretty safe bet he's never met a rabbit like me.

659
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,259
一米八五的身高
Six-foot-one,

660
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,544
还有钢铁般的意志
nerves of steel.

661
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,755
太极拳大师 古代艺术的...
Master of tai-chi and the ancient art of...

662
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,422

00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,303
别跑! 坐下!
Stop! Sit!

664
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,551
坐下 乖女孩 坐下!
Down, girl, down!

665
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:52,973

00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,846
沙沙!

667
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,101
沙沙!
Sandy!

668
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,774
她很狂躁! 让这澳洲野狗离我远点!
She's rabid! Get this dingo off me!

669
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,947
哦 不
Oh, no.

670
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,736
拐杖糖...
Candy canes...

671
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,074
哇哦!
Whoa!

672
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,284
真糟
Whoops.

673
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,415
哦 我真希望现在有部照相机
Oh, I really wish I had a camera right now.

674
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,140
沙沙 快来! 我们去找食虫人!
Sandy, come on! We can find Pitch!

675
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,443
漂漂
Pretty.

676
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,992
小兔子 蹦 蹦 跳!
Bunny, hop, hop. Hop!

677
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,326
哦!

678
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,702
哎哟!
Ow!

679
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,548
什么... 哈?
What... Huh?

680
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,463
呜哦!
Whoo!

681
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,845
真爽!
Yes!

682
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,373
我冻住它了
I got it.

683
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,540
沙沙!
Sandy!

684
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,542
沙沙 你看到了吗?
Sandy, did you see that?

685
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,416
看看这个东西
Look at this thing.

686
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,381
杰克冻人?
Frost?

687
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,260
要知道 作为中立方
You know, for a neutral party,

688
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:56,225
你跟那些怪咖在一起的时间过多了
you spend an awful lot of time with those weirdos.

689
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,727
这不是你的战斗 杰克
This isn't your fight, Jack.

690
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,766
你偷了那些牙齿的时候就把我牵扯进来了!
You made it my fight when you stole those teeth!

691
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,516
牙齿? 你干嘛在乎那些牙齿?
Teeth? Why do you care about the teeth?

692
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,405
这才是我要找的人
Now this is who I'm looking for.

693
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,584
这倒提醒我了 千万不能跟你作对
Remind me not to get on your bad side.

694
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,758
好了 放松点 我就想试试 你别怪我 沙沙
Okay, easy. You can't blame me for trying, Sandy.

695
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:36,679
你不知道虚弱又被人恨的感觉是怎样的
You don't know what it's like to be weak and hated.

696
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,681
我真是太笨了 竟然想扰乱你的美梦
It was stupid of me to mess with your dreams.

697
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,512
所以 这么办吧
So, I'll tell you what.

698
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,439
你可以把它们拿回去
You can have them back.

699
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,242
你对付左边的
You take the ones on the left,

700
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,994
我对付右边的?
I'll take the ones on the right?

701
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,334
出击!
Boo!

702
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,672
哈?
Huh?

703
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,498
来吧!
Come on!

704
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,010
你最好弯腰躲一下
You might want to duck.

705
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,187
我们得帮帮沙沙!
We've got to help Sandy!

706
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,651
呀!
Yah!

707
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,408
不!
No!

708
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,891
杰克!
Jack!

709
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,701
不要跟恐惧作对 小个子!
Don't fight the fear, little man!

710
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,130
快点! 快点 杰克!
Hurry! Hurry, Jack!

711
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:36,052
我想说"做个好梦" 可是美梦已不复存在了
I'd say "Sweet dreams," But there aren't any left.

712
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,226
沙沙?
Sandy?

713
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,436
不!
No!

714
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:50,604
不!
No!

715
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,633
杰克!
Jack!

716
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,259
杰克 你是怎么做到的?
Jack, how did you do that?

717
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:29,059
我都不知道自己有这力量
I didn't know I could.

718
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:40,779
终于!
Finally!

719
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,119
出现了一个可以玩玩的人了!
Someone who knows how to have a little fun!

720
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,180
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

721
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,347
我只是...
I just...

722
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,426
我希望当时能做点什么
I wish I could've done something.

723
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:49,723
做点什么?
Done something?

724
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,101
杰克 你勇敢地抵抗了食虫人 你救了我们!
Jack, you stood up to Pitch. You saved us!

725
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,352
可是沙沙...
But Sandy...

726
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,855
他会为你的举动骄傲的
Would be proud of what you did.

727
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,486
我不知道你的前世是怎样的
I don't know who you were in your past life.

728
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,532
但在今生 你是名守护者
But in this life, you are Guardian.

729
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:11,874
但不知道过往 我怎能了解现在的自己?
But how can I know who I am until I find out who I was?

730
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,868
你会的
You will.

731
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,870
我感觉得到
I feel it

732
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,750
我的肚子告诉我的
in my belly.

733
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,718
看这些灯灭得多快
Look how fast they're going out.

734
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,754
是恐惧
It's fear.

735
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,882
平衡已被打破
He's tipped the balance.

736
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,686
嘿 打起精神 你们这些糊涂蛋!
Hey, buck up, you sad sacks!

737
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,227
我们还可以扭转战局!
We can still turn this around!

738
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,230
明天就是复活节
Easter is tomorrow.

739
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:43,443
我需要你们的帮助 只要我们全力以赴
And I need your help. I say we pull out all the stops

740
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:46,238
就能让这些小光点们再次闪动
and we get those little lights flickering again.

741
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,114
兔子说得对
Bunny is right.

742
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,908
老朋友 尽管这么说让我很痛心
As much as it pains me to say, old friend,

743
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,080
这次 复活节远比圣诞节重要
this time, Easter is more important than Christmas.

744
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,584
嘿 大伙儿听到了吗?
Hey, did everyone hear that?

745
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,834
我们必须赶快到兔子洞 各位! 上雪橇!
We must hurry to the warren. Everyone! To the sleigh!

746
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:06,421
哦 不 伙计 我的兔子洞我作主 系好安全带
Oh, no, mate. My warren, my rules. Buckle up.

747
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,430
完蛋了!
Shostakovich!

748
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,931
哦!
Oh!

749
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,978
"系好安全带" 太好玩了
"Buckle up." Is very funny.

750
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,947
欢迎来到兔子洞
Welcome to the warren.

751
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,744
有情况
Something's up.

752
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,431
苏菲吗?
Sophie?

753
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,137
精灵 精灵 小精灵!  她在这干嘛?
Elf, elf, elf! What is she doing here?

754
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,397
我丢了雪景球
Ah, snow globe.

755
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,145
该死! 快点想办法
Crikey! Somebody do something.

756
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,480
哦 别看我 她看不见我 记得吗?
Oh, don't look at me. I'm invisible, remember?

757
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:03,982
小精灵! 小精灵!
Elf! Elf!

758
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,906
别担心 兔子 我打赌她是仙女迷
Don't worry, Bunny. I bet she's a fairy fan.

759
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,949
没事 小家伙  漂漂
It's okay, little one. Pretty.

760
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,739
哦! 知道吗? 我有东西给你!
Oh! You know what? I've got something for you!

761
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,287
在这里!
Here it is!

762
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,285
看这些漂亮的牙齿
Look at all the pretty teeth,

763
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:17,037
上面还有血和牙龈呢!
with little blood and gum on them!

764
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,246
血和牙龈?
Blood and gums?

765
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,501
你们最后一次和孩子们玩耍
When was the last time

766
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,674
都是什么时候的事了?
you guys actually hung out with kids?

767
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,917
躲猫猫!
Peek-a-boo!

768
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,050
我们忙于把快乐带给孩子们
We are very busy bringing joy to children.

769
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,013
我们没有时间...
We don't have time...

770
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,887
陪孩子们玩了  嗯
For children. Hmm.

771
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:38,809
如果一个小屁孩就能毁了复活节
If one little kid can ruin Easter,

772
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,655
那我们的处境比我想的糟多了
then we're in worse shape than I thought.

773
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,151
你想画蛋吗? 想吗?
You want to paint some eggs? Yeah?

774
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,407
好的  来吧
Okay. Come on.

775
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,418
壮观!
Rimsky-Korsakov!

776
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,045
真是很多蛋啊
That's a lot of eggs.

777
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,046
呃 我们还有多少时间?
Uh, how much time do we have?

778
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,755
好了 大军 是时候反击了
All right, troops, it's time to push back.

779
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,932
让彩蛋遍布全球!
That means eggs everywhere!

780
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,052
你们要成堆出现在每栋高楼
Heaps of you in every high-rise,

781
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:20,100
农场 还有活动房屋里!
farmhouse, and trailer park!

782
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,107
还有网球鞋和早餐碗里
In tennis shoes and cereal bowls.

783
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,523
哦 还有五彩糖果浴!
Oh, there will be bathtubs filled with my beautiful googies!

784
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,621
好吧 这颜色有点怪
Okay, that's a little strange.

785
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:38,910
不 伙计
No, mate.

786
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,575
这很可爱
That's adorable.

787
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,505
这会是春天! 降临每块大陆!
There will be springtime! On every continent!

788
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,129
我会将希望带给大家!
And I'm bringing hope with me!

789
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,185
太圣诞节了 伙计 把它们涂成蓝色
Too Christmas-y, mate. Paint them blue.

790
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,145
哦 那个是什么?
Oh, what's over there?

791
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,944
真是颗漂亮的彩蛋!
Oh, that's a beauty!

792
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,530
现在 我们只要把他和他的小伙伴们
Now, all we got to do is get him and his little mates

793
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,323
通过地下通道送到地面
through the tunnels to the top

794
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:16,160
复活节就来临了
and we'll have ourselves Easter.

795
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,915
干得不错
Not bad.

796
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,260
你干得不错
Not bad yourself.

797
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,465
听着 我很抱歉...
Look, I'm sorry about the whole...

798
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,684
你知道的 说你是袋鼠的事
You know, the kangaroo thing.

799
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,311
是口音的问题 对吧?
It's the accent, isn't it?

800
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,976
哦 可怜的小家伙 看看她 都累坏了
Oh, poor little ankle-biter. Look at her. All tuckered out.

801
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,773
我好爱她
I love her.

802
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,355
我想该送她回家了
I think it's time to get her home.

803
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,652
我送她回家怎么样?
How about I take her home?

804
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,739
杰克 不行 食虫人他...  他的力量不如我
Jack, no. Pitch is... No match for this.

805
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,617
所以我们需要你在身边
Which is why we need you here with us.

806
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,999
相信我 我会像兔子一样快的
Trust me. I'll be quick as a bunny.

807
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,008
哦
Ooh.

808
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,557
苏菲? 是你吗?
Sophie? Is that you?

809
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,065
我们该回去了
We should get back.

810
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,527
杰克!
Jack!

811
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,027
这声音 我记得这声音
That voice, I know that voice.

812
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,525
杰克!
Jack!

813
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,042
杰克!
Jack!

814
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,590
杰克!
Jack!

815
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,555
别担心 还有时间
Don't worry, there's still time.

816
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,443
杰克?
Jack?

817
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,959
小牙仙 别闹!
Baby Tooth, come on!

818
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:31,245
我得找到那是什么声音
I have to find out what that is.

819
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,593
嘘! 别出声!
Shh! Keep it down!

820
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,061
我马上带你们出去 只要我...
I'm gonna get you out of here just as soon as...

821
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,262
杰克?
Jack?

822
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,265
杰克!
Jack!

823
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,609
找到办法
...as I can.

824
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,951
在找什么东西吗?
Looking for something?

825
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,918
别害怕 杰克 我不会伤害你的
Don't be afraid, Jack. I'm not gonna hurt you.

826
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:14,126
害怕? 我可不怕你
Afraid? I'm not afraid of you.

827
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,128
或许不 但你在害怕别的事情
Maybe not. But you are afraid of something.

828
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,843
你竟然这样想?  我知道就是这样!
You think so, huh? I know so!

829
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,089
一直以来我都很清楚
It's the one thing I always know.

830
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,173
人类最大的恐惧
People's greatest fears.

831
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,511
你的就是永远没有人会相信你
Yours is that no one will ever believe in you.

832
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:36,986
而且最糟糕的是 你害怕自己永远不知道原因
And worst of all, you're afraid you'll never know why.

833
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,316
为什么是你?
Why you?

834
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:43,113
为什么要选你做守护者?
Why were you chosen to be like this?

835
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,989
不过不用害怕
Well, fear not.

836
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,659
因为答案就在这里
For the answer to that is right here.

837
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:54,120
你想要吗 杰克? 你的记忆?
Do you want them, Jack? Your memories?

838
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,845
你想知道的一切 都在这个小盒子里
Everything you wanted to know, in this little box.

839
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,478
你为什么会变成这样? 别人看不到你
Why did you end up like this? Unseen.

840
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,851
不能接触任何人
Unable to reach out to anyone.

841
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:17,560
你太想知道答案了 你想抓住它们
You want the answers so badly. You want to grab them

842
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,024
然后私自飞走 但你害怕
and fly off with them. But you're afraid

843
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,406
其他守护者会怎么想
of what the Guardians will think.

844
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,490
你害怕让他们失望
You're afraid of disappointing them.

845
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,652
好了 让我帮你搞清一件事
Well, let me ease your mind about one thing.

846
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,162
他们永远都不会真心接纳你的 永远不会
They'll never accept you. Not really.

847
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,329
住嘴!
Stop it!

848
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,656
别说了!
Stop it!

849
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,413
毕竟 你不是他们中的一员
After all, you're not one of them.

850
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,081
你不知道我是谁
You don't know what I am.

851
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:38,251
我当然知道! 你是杰克冻人
Of course I do! You're Jack Frost.

852
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,548
你所到之处一片狼藉
You make a mess wherever you go.

853
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,384
为什么 因为你现在就是这样
Why, you're doing it right now.

854
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,545
你做了什么?
What did you do?

855
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,181
杰克 更重要的是你做了什么?
More to the point, Jack, what did you do?

856
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,396
小牙仙!
Baby Tooth!

857
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,403
复活节快乐 杰克
Happy Easter, Jack.

858
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,409
不
No.

859
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,452
这儿没有彩蛋
There aren't any eggs.

860
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,538
这儿什么都没有  我放弃了
There's nothing here. I give up.

861
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,331
他没来  我不明白
He didn't come. I don't understand.

862
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,956
或许他只是今年藏得特别好
Maybe he just hid them really well this year.

863
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,116
孩子们!  我都找遍了 什么都没有
Kids, oh! I checked everywhere. There's nothing.

864
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,705
有的 在这儿! 在这儿!
Yes, there is! There is!

865
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,256
我知道 这不是我最好看的彩蛋
I mean, these aren't my best looking googies,

866
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:22,545
但在紧要关头也能凑合
but they'll do in a pinch.

867
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:23,921
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

868
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,335
我知道
I know.

869
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:28,263
根本就没有复活节兔子
There's no such thing as the Easter Bunny.

870
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,927
什么? 不
What? No.

871
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,971
错了! 不是的!
Wrong! Not true!

872
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,540
我就在你们面前 孩子们  为什么他不来?
I'm right in front of you, mate. Why wouldn't he come?

873
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,765
他们看不到我
They don't see me.

874
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,934
他们看不到我了
They don't see me.

875
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,490
杰克 你去哪了?
Jack, where were you?

876
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,994
噩梦已经侵入了地下洞
The Nightmares attacked the tunnels.

877
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:54,581
他们砸碎了每只蛋 压碎了每只篮子
They smashed every egg, crushed every basket.

878
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,000
没有一只蛋安全到达地面
Nothing made it to the surface.

879
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,002
杰克
Jack.

880
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:03,086
你从哪拿的那个?
Where did you get that?

881
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,633
我... 这是...
I was... It's...

882
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,088
小牙仙在哪?
Where's Baby Tooth?

883
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,513
哦 杰克 你做了什么?
Oh, Jack, what have you done?

884
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,183
这是你没回来的原因?
That is why you weren't here?

885
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,852
你和食虫人在一起?
You were with Pitch?

886
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,596
不 听我说 听我说
No, listen, listen.

887
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,191
我很抱歉 我不是有意这样的
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen.

888
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,226
他必须离开  什么?
He has to go. What?

889
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,483
我们就不该相信你的!
We should never have trusted you!

890
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:33,162
复活节是新的开始 新的生活
Easter is new beginnings, new life.

891
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,032
复活节是希望的象征
Easter's about hope.

892
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,622
现在一切都没了
And now it's gone.

893
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,690
哇哦! 哇哦 哇哦!
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

894
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,358
啊!
Aah!

895
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,447
我们再翻一遍公园吧
Let's check the park again.

896
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,655
真的吗?  为了什么? 复活节兔子?
Really? For what? The Easter Bunny?

897
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,660
大伙儿 我说了 我看到他了!
Guys, I told you, I saw him!

898
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:18,939
他比我想象的大很多
He's way bigger than I thought

899
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,992
而且他还有很酷的回旋镖什么的!
and he's got these cool boomerang things!

900
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:23,920
成熟点吧 杰米  哦 伙计 开玩笑的吧?
Grow up, Jamie. Oh, man. Seriously?

901
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,422
你们到底怎么了?
What's happened to you guys?

902
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,635
那是梦而已!
It was a dream!

903
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,839
你应该开心还能有那样的梦
You should be happy you still get dreams like that

904
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,265
而不是...
and not...

905
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,218
噩梦
Nightmares.

906
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:42,889
算了吧 杰米
Forget it, Jamie.

907
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,902
今年就是没有复活节了
There's just no Easter this year.

908
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,271
他的确是真的!
He really is real!

909
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,407
我知道他是
I know he is.

910
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,429
我就知道会变成这样
I thought this might happen.

911
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,440
他们从没有真的信任过你
They never really believed in you.

912
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,810
我只是想帮你证实这点
I was just trying to show you that.

913
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,603
但是我了解你的心情
But I understand.

914
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,615
你什么都不了解!
You don't understand anything!

915
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:37,445
不了解? 我不知道被驱逐的滋味吗?
No? I don't know what it's like to be cast out?

916
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,950
不被相信的滋味?
To not be believed in?

917
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,250
渴望家庭的滋味
To long for a family.

918
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,631
在阴影里那么多年 我认为
All those years in the shadows I thought

919
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,471
没人比我更清楚这种感觉
no one else knows what this feels like.

920
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,091
但现在我知道自己错了
But now I see I was wrong.

921
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:04,054
我们不必孤身一人 杰克
We don't have to be alone, Jack.

922
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:08,142
我相信你 我知道孩子们也会相信的
I believe in you. And I know children will, too.

923
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,272
相信我?
In me?

924
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,649
是的!
Yes!

925
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,523
看看我们的能力吧
Look at what we can do.

926
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,493
还有什么比寒冷和黑暗结合更强大的?
What goes together better than cold and dark?

927
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,283
我们可以让他们相信
We can make them believe.

928
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:23,992
我们可以给他们一个世界 那里的一切都是...
We'll give them a world where everything, everything is...

929
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,542
食虫人吗?
Pitch black?

930
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,828
还有杰克冻人
And Jack Frost, too.

931
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,047
他们都会相信我们两个
They'll believe in both of us.

932
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,668
不 他们会害怕我们两个 而那不是我想要的
No, they'll fear both of us. And that's not what I want.

933
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,845
现在最后警告你一次
Now for the last time,

934
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,880
离我远点
leave me alone.

935
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:46,021
非常好 你想不被人打扰 可以 但首先...
Very well. You want to be left alone. Done. But first...

936
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,309
小牙仙!
Baby Tooth!

937
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,020
把拐杖给我 杰克!
The staff, Jack!

938
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,567
你有个多管闲事的坏习惯
You have a bad habit of interfering.

939
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:02,697
现在把冰杖给我 我就放了她
Now, hand it over, and I'll let her go.

940
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,547
好了
All right.

941
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,219
现在放了她
Now let her go.

942
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,597
不
No.

943
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,138
你刚才说你想独自一个人
You said you wanted to be alone.

944
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,723
那就一个人吧!
So be alone!

945
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,189
不要!
No!

946
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,136
小牙仙!
Baby Tooth!

947
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,597
你没事吧?
You all right?

948
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:10,100
对不起 我只有让你挨冻的份
Sorry. All I can do is keep you cold.

949
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,150
食虫人说得对
Pitch was right.

950
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,942
我把事情搞得一塌糊涂
I make a mess of everything.

951
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,446
嘿
Hey.

952
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,833
杰克?
Jack?

953
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,132
杰克!
Jack!

954
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,340
哦!
Oh!

955
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,962
杰克!
Jack!

956
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:00,696
回来 杰克
Come on, Jack,

957
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,111
你不能总玩
you can't have fun all the time.

958
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,533
杰克 从上面下来
Jack, get down from there.

959
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,826
杰克!  你真好玩 杰克
Jack! You're funny, Jack.

960
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,993
小心点
Be careful.

961
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,158
会的
We will.

962
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,709
没事 没事
It's okay. It's okay.

963
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,178
不要往下看 看着我
Don't look down. Just look at me.

964
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,508
杰克
Jack.

965
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,472
我害怕
I'm scared.

966
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,346
我知道 我知道
I know. I know.

967
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:35,353
但你不会有事的 你不会掉下去的
But you're gonna be all right. You're not gonna fall in.

968
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:38,189
我们来玩些好玩的!
We're gonna have a little fun instead!

969
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,694
不可能!
No, we're not!

970
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,188
我会骗你吗?
Would I trick you?

971
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,072
会呀! 你老是骗我!
Yes! You always play tricks!

972
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,486
好吧
All right.

973
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,284
但这次没骗你
Well, not this time.

974
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,578
我保证 我保证 你...
I promise, I promise. You're gonna be...

975
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,580
你会没事的
You're gonna be fine.

976
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,699
你必须相信我
You have to believe in me.

977
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:58,083
想玩游戏吗? 我们来玩跳房子!
You want to play a game? We're gonna play hopscotch!

978
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,501
就跟我们平时玩的一样
Like we play every day.

979
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,333
很简单
It's as easy as

980
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,214
一...
one...

981
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,674
哇!
Whoa!

982
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,555
二
Two.

983
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,340
三!
Three!

984
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,718
好了
All right.

985
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,394
该你了
Now it's your turn.

986
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:14,645
一...
One...

987
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,098
很棒 很棒
That's it, that's it.

988
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,769
二
Two.

989
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:18,983
三!
Three!

990
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,357
啊!
Whoa!

991
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,068
杰克!
Jack!

992
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,473
你... 你看见了吗?
Did you see... Did you see that?

993
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,263
是我!
It was me!

994
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,558
我有个家! 有个妹妹!
I had a family! I had a sister!

995
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,601
我还救了她!
I saved her!

996
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,318
这是你选我的原因吧
That's why you chose me.

997
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,077
我是个守护者
I'm a Guardian.

998
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,076
我们得离开这儿
We have to get out of here.

999
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:28,799
好吧
Okay.

1000
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,383
我们走 小牙仙 我欠你个人情!
Come on, Baby Tooth, I owe you one!

1001
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,787
快! 我们走!
Come on! Let's go!

1002
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,991
怎么了?
What's wrong?

1003
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,832
你们都不能飞了?
None of you can fly?

1004
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,540
那些光点
The lights.

1005
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:19,562
你们可以下岗了!
You're all free to go!

1006
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,478
孩子们今年不需要圣诞玩具了
We won't be needing any Christmas toys this year,

1007
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,025
谢谢
thank you.

1008
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:25,856
以后都不需要了
Nor ever again.

1009
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,651
光点都灭了
They're all going out.

1010
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,661
只留下六个孩子
Only six left.

1011
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:37,535
六个宝贵的孩子
Six precious children

1012
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:41,201
仍然死心塌地相信守护者
who still believe in the Guardians with all their hearts.

1013
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,457
现在只剩下
Make that

1014
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:44,662
五个
five.

1015
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,040
哦!
Oh!

1016
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,921
四个
Four.

1017
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,048
三个!
Three!

1018
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,216
两个!
Two!

1019
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,563
一个
One.

1020
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,064
杰米
Jamie.

1021
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:14,947
听着
Okay, look.

1022
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,871
你和我显然到了人们所说的人生分叉口
You and I are obviously at what they call a crossroads.

1023
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,948
所以我们这么办吧
So here's what's gonna happen.

1024
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:25,120
如果守护者不是骗人的 你真的存在
If it wasn't a dream and if you are real

1025
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:29,712
你必须证明 现在就证明
then you have to prove it, like, right now.

1026
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:41,765
我相信你很长时间了 对吧?
I've believed in you for a long time, okay?

1027
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:44,264
事实上 我一直都相信你
Like, my whole life, in fact.

1028
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,607
所以你多少欠我一个人情
So you kind of owe me now.

1029
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:50,570
不需要太麻烦 给我一点点示意让我知道你存在
You don't have to do much. Just a little sign so I know.

1030
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,449
做什么都行
Anything.

1031
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,450
什么都行
Anything at all.

1032
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,951
我就知道
I knew it.

1033
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:37,943
他是真的!
He's real!

1034
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:47,957
哇哦!
Whoa!

1035
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,050
哇哦!
Whoa!

1036
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,838
雪?
Snow?

1037
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,186
杰克冻人
Jack Frost.

1038
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:11,233
他刚才说...
Did he just say...

1039
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,194
杰克冻人?
Jack Frost?

1040
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:16,197
他又说了 他说...
He said it again. He said...

1041
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:17,361
你说...
You said...

1042
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,699
杰克冻人!
Jack Frost!

1043
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:23,113
没错!
That's right!

1044
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:27,042
就是我! 杰克冻人! 这是我的名字!
But that's me! Jack Frost! That's my name!

1045
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,039
你刚才叫了我的名字!
You said my name!

1046
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,582
等等 你能听到我说话?
Wait. Can you hear me?

1047
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,214
你能...
Can you...

1048
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:39,091
你能看见我?
Can you see me?

1049
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,763
他能看见我! 他能看见我!
He sees me! He sees me!

1050
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:49,397
刚才是你下的雪!  是啊!
You just made it snow! I know!

1051
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,102
在我的房间!  没错!
In my room! I know!

1052
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:52,726
你真的存在?  对呀!
You're real? Yeah!

1053
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,611
除了我还有谁会在你的房间下雪啊?
Who do you think brings you all the blizzards and the snow days?

1054
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,901
你还记得那天你坐着雪橇上飞吗?
And you remember when you went flying on that sled the other day?

1055
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,737
原来是你?  正是!
That was you? That was me!

1056
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,279
酷!  是吧?
Cool! Right?

1057
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,823
那复活节兔子和牙仙是真的吗?
But what about the Easter Bunny? And the Tooth Fairy?

1058
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:07,282
真的 真的! 我们都是真的
Real, real, real! Every one of us is real.

1059
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,498
我就知道!
I knew it!

1060
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,996
杰米 你在和谁说话?
Jamie, who are you talking to?

1061
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:11,202
嗯...
Um...

1062
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:14,588
杰克冻人?
Jack Frost?

1063
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,296
好吧
Okay.

1064
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,308
喔 喔 小心!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1065
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,941
我的孩子们! 回来!
Ah, moi deti! Come back!

1066
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,526
诺斯 你没事吧?  现在可以明确告诉你
North, are you okay? Is official.

1067
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,945
我的魔法失灵了
My powers are kaput.

1068
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,609
看!
Look!

1069
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:43,617
杰克!
Jack!

1070
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:45,449
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

1071
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,122
你在这干什么?
What are you doing here?

1072
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,283
和你们一样
Same as you.

1073
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,712
最后的光点
The last light.

1074
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,633
哇 是你! 竟然是你!
Wow. It is you! I mean, it is you!

1075
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,969
我就知道你们是真的!
I knew it wasn't a dream!

1076
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,049
杰克 他能看见你
Jack, he sees you.

1077
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,053
对了 兔子哪去了?
Wait. But where's Bunny?

1078
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:13,231
复活节计划的失败给我们造成很大损失
Losing Easter took its toll on all of us.

1079
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,316
尤其是对兔子
Bunny most of all.

1080
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,481
不会吧
Oh, no.

1081
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,118
他就是复活节兔子?
That's the Easter Bunny?

1082
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:27,908
总算有人看见我了!
Now somebody sees me!

1083
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:30,115
你一小时前干什么呢 伙计?
Where were you about an hour ago, mate?

1084
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,624
他怎么了?
What happened to him?

1085
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,501
他以前高大威猛 但现在变成了...
He used to be huge and cool. And now he's...

1086
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,329
小可爱
Cute.

1087
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,627
很好
Oh, that's good.

1088
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,088
这是你教他说的吗? 肯定是!
Did you tell him to say that? That's it!

1089
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,340
来吧! 我们较量一下! 来!
Let's go! Me and you! Come on!

1090
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,846
不 事实上 他告诉我你是真的
No. Actually, he told me you were real.

1091
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,471
我差点认为你是骗人的
Just when I started to think that maybe you weren't.

1092
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,427
他让你相信了?
He made you believe?

1093
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:53,646
我?
In me?

1094
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:10,204
保护杰米离开这
Get Jamie out of here.

1095
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,031
小心点 杰克
Be careful, Jack.

1096
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:17,203
杰克冻人
Jack Frost.

1097
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,206
我们是不是该做个了断了?
Let's end this, shall we?

1098
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,125
啊!
Aah!

1099
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:26,346
这点小把戏对我没用了
That little trick doesn't work on me anymore.

1100
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:33,686
这边 这边
This way, this way.

1101
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,773
啊 是死胡同 往这走 这边!
Ahh, dead end. Other way, other way!

1102
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:41,727
杰克!
Jack!

1103
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,615
杰克 刚才的尝试很勇敢 论苦劳给你满分
That was good try, Jack. "A" For effort.

1104
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:49,406
他变强了 我赢不了他
He's stronger. I can't beat him.

1105
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,406
喔!
Aw!

1106
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:58,077
我这么大费周章 全因为一个小男孩
All this fuss over one little boy,

1107
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:01,168
到现在还不改信念
and still he refuses to stop believing.

1108
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:04,091
很好 反正有的是办法
Very well. There are other ways

1109
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,252
灭掉光点
to snuff out a light.

1110
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,923
你想杀他 先过我这一关
If you want him, you're gonna have to go through me.

1111
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,593
看你毛茸茸的样
Look how fluffy you are.

1112
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:17,062
我来给你挠挠耳朵吧?
Would you like a scratch behind the ears?

1113
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:18,338
你休想
Don't you even think about it.

1114
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,017
看到你们现在这个样子
I can't tell you how happy it makes me

1115
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,068
我不知道有多开心
to see you all like this.

1116
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,823
你们看起来糟透了
You look awful.

1117
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,456
杰克 我害怕
Jack. I'm scared.

1118
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,122
杰克 我害怕
Jack. I'm scared.

1119
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,674
我知道 我知道
I know, I know.

1120
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,678
但你不会有事的
But you're gonna be all right.

1121
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,424
我们来玩些好玩的
We're gonna have a little fun instead.

1122
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,974
没错! 这就是我的专长!
That's it! That's my center!

1123
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,141
你感觉如何 杰米?
So what do you think, Jamie?

1124
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,313
现在相信食虫人了吗...
Do you believe in the Boogey...

1125
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,325
我们去找你的朋友
Now let's go get your friends.

1126
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:17,536
哦!
Ohh!

1127
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,667
哇!
Whoa!

1128
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,004
棒极了!
Cool!

1129
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,898
哦
Oh.

1130
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,405
杰米 你怎么会飞?
Jamie, how are you doing that?

1131
01:16:57,571 --> 01:17:00,199
是杰克冻人! 快起来 我们需要你帮忙!
Jack Frost! Come on, we need your help!

1132
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,329
那是...
Hey, is that...

1133
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:06,042
杰克冻人!
Jack Frost!

1134
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:10,251
啊?
Huh?

1135
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,592
圣诞快乐!  复活节快乐!
Merry Christmas! Happy Easter!

1136
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,055
吃完糖别忘了用牙线清洁牙齿!
Don't forget to floss!

1137
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:18,722
小蛋糕?  什么?
Cupcake? What?

1138
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:22,730
杰米 你说对了!
Jamie, you were right!

1139
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:24,565
真的有复活节兔子!
The Easter Bunny's real!

1140
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,283
还有牙仙!  还有圣诞老人!
The Tooth Fairy! And Santa!

1141
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:27,689
他们都是真的!
They're all real!

1142
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,117
喔! 耶!
Whoo! Yeah!

1143
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:45,248
你们觉得几个孩子能助你们打败它们?
You think a few children can help you? Against this?

1144
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,087
这只是噩梦而已 杰米
They're just bad dreams, Jamie.

1145
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,257
我来保护你 伙计
And we'll protect you, mate.

1146
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,597
你保护他们?
Aw, you'll protect them?

1147
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,434
那谁来保护你啊?
But who will protect you?

1148
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,281
我来
I will.

1149
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,112

I will.

1150
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,411

还有我
And me.

1152
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,786
我试试吧
I'll try.

1153
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:32,296
现在还不相信食虫人是真的吗?
Still think there's no such thing as the Boogeyman?

1154
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:43,977
我相信你是真的 但我不怕你
I do believe in you. I'm just not afraid of you.

1155
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,200
啊?
Huh?

1156
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,667
耶 牙仙!
Yeah, Tooth Fairy!

1157
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,788
好棒!
A-ha!

1158
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,338
哦 耶!
Oh. Yeah!

1159
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,296
不! 抓住他们!
No! Get them!

1160
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,460
看你们的了!
DO your jobs!

1161
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:18,425
快变身 快变身
Oh, yeah, come on, come on.

1162
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:19,551
妈呀!
Oh, crikey!

1163
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,520
不可能吧!
No way!

1164
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,187
我只是个小兔子!
I'm just a bunny!

1165
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,312
你好 伙计
G'day, mate.

1166
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,413
喔!
Whoa!

1167
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,245
冲啊! 喔... 吼!
Come on! Whoo-hoo!

1168
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,333
干掉他们!
Let's get them!

1169
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,713
一块上啊 朋友们 我们能行!
Come on, guys, we can do it!

1170
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,896
留给你了 伙计
It's all ours, mate.

1171
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,602
谢谢 牙牙
Thanks, Tooth.

1172
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:17,067
哦 哦
Ho, ho, ho.

1173
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:21,738
来错屋顶了
Wrong roof.

1174
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:39,961
看这!
Look at that!

1175
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,716
我明白了!
I got it!

1176
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:44,765
我知道我们该怎么做了 朋友们 跟我来
I know what we have to do. Guys, come on.

1177
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:46,763
结束了 食虫人
It's over, Pitch.

1178
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,802
你无处可逃了
There's no place to hide.

1179
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:58,945
杰克 小心!
Jack, look out!

1180
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:19,629
沙人!
The Sandman!

1181
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:31,308
伙计 你来的真是时候
Mate, you are a sight for sore eyes.

1182
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,362
嗯
Hmm.

1183
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:57,667
漂漂!
Pretty!

1184
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,805
你的专长?
Your center?

1185
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:50,048
啊?
Hmm?

1186
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,134
用了一些时间
It took a while,

1187
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:53,931
最后终于明白了
but I figured it out.

1188
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:05,731
哦...  哦!
Oh... Oh!

1189
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,491
你们这些捣蛋鬼!
You're all on naughty list!

1190
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,944
兔子 接招!
Bunny, think fast!

1191
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,666
不
No.

1192
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:24,128
你们竟敢当着我的面打闹?
You dare have fun in my presence?

1193
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:29,259
我可是人人害怕的食虫人!
I am the Boogeyman and you will fear me!

1194
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,926
不! 不
No! No.

1195
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,115
这么快就走啊?
Leaving the party so soon?

1196
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:50,651
还没说再见呢
You didn't even say goodbye.

1197
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,287
硬币?
A quarter?

1198
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,953
这一拳是为我的小精灵打的
And that's for my fairies.

1199
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:04,753
你们消灭不了我的! 永远不会
You can't get rid of me! Not forever.

1200
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:07,004
恐惧不会消失
There will always be fear.

1201
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:11,593
那又怎么样? 只要还有一个孩子相信我们
So what? As long as one child believes,

1202
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:14,642
我们就会和恐惧战斗到底
we will be here to fight fear.

1203
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:18,637
真的吗? 那他们在这干什么呢?
Really? Then what are they doing here?

1204
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:25,068
他们肯定不是我的噩梦 我不害怕
They can't be my Nightmares. I'm not afraid.

1205
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,699
看起来是他们闻到的是你的恐惧
Looks like it's your fear they smell.

1206
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:45,919
不 不!
No, no, no. No!

1207
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,339
不!
No!

1208
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:10,864
杰克 你准备好了吗? 正式成为守护者
Are you ready now, Jack? To make it official.

1209
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:17,746
现在是宣誓仪式
Then is time you take Oath.

1210
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,543
杰克冻人 你愿意
Will you, Jack Frost,

1211
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:27,706
宣誓守护全世界的孩子
vow to watch over the children of the world,

1212
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:29,549
用你的生命去守护
to guard them with your life,

1213
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,595
他们的希望 奇迹和梦想吗?
their hopes, their wishes, and their dreams,

1214
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:36,761
孩子是我们拥有的一切 我们为他们而生
for they are all that we have, all that we are,

1215
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:39,476
直到永远
and all that we will ever be?

1216
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:45,641
我愿意
I will.

1217
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:50,488
那恭喜你 因为你已经
Then, congratulations, Jack Frost, for you are now,

1218
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,690
永远成为了
and forevermore,

1219
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:54,116
一名守护者
a Guardian.

1220
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:04,972
好样的
That's my boy.

1221
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:11,750
别太激动了 姑娘们
Keep it together, girls.

1222
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:17,923
伙计们 看!
You guys, look!

1223
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,809
那是圣诞老人的雪橇  哇 真的有!
That's Santa's sleigh. Wow, it's real!

1224
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:23,846
你们看见了吗?
You guys see that?

1225
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:27,561
人人都爱雪橇
Everyone loves the sleigh.

1226
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:29,439
看看那个!
Wow, look at that!

1227
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,271
该走了
Time to go.

1228
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,322
太漂亮了
It's beautiful.

1229
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,411
复活节快乐 小不点
Happy Easter, you little ankle-biter.

1230
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:48,711
我会想念你的
I'm gonna miss you.

1231
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:50,797
再见 兔子
Bye-bye, Bunny.

1232
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,466
你们要走了吗?
You're leaving?

1233
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,343
食虫人再来怎么办?
But what if Pitch comes back?

1234
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,839
如果我们又不信守护者了怎么办? 如果看不到你们...
What if we stop believing again? If I can't see you...

1235
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,717
别担心 别担心
Hey, slow down, slow down.

1236
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,776
我告诉你
You're telling me you stop

1237
01:27:02,777 --> 01:27:04,428
难道太阳出来以后 你就不相信月亮了吗
believing in the moon when the sun comes up?

1238
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:05,603
不是
No.

1239
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,852
那当乌云遮住太阳
Okay. Well, do you stop believing in the sun

1240
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:09,395
你就不相信太阳了吗?
when clouds block it out?

1241
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,896
不
No.

1242
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:15,322
杰米 我们从未离开
We'll always be there, Jamie. And now,

1243
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,733
我们会一直在这
we'll always be here.

1244
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:22,534
它也会使你成为一名守护者的
Which kind of makes you a Guardian, too.

1245
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:29,995
杰克!
Jack!

1246
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,383
驾!
Yah!

1247
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:58,611
我叫杰克冻人
My name is Jack Frost.

1248
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,442
我是一名守护者
And I'm a Guardian.

1249
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,152
我怎么知道的?
How do I know that?

1250
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:04,533
月亮告诉我的
Because the moon told me so.

1251
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,083
所以当月亮告诉你一些事
So when the moon tells you something,

1252
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:10,828
那就相信吧
believe it.
